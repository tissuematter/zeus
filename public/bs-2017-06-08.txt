All APIs get their own:
 dns name -> gateway
Partition Data layer
Call comes into gateway, we direct device to it’s partition
Our data layer is distributed so we can route user A to partition A
  we can route Me to the partition I support
  we can route You to the partition you support
  Partners get routed to the future release partition so all experience what we are about to…
  Release into the customer partition

VLAN (yes each api is segmented into it’s own VLAN)
 Nginx hosts knows all about api farm
